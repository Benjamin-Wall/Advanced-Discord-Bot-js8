# Advanced Discord Bot

From kicking and banning people to giving roles for specific amounts of time, this Discord bot can be helpful for anyone who wants to learn how to make
a discord.js bot, I made this so new users can also look at the methods used for certain commands and get some ideas for their Discord bot.

## Getting Started

* You will need [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for the play, stop and skip commands, as ytdl-core package needs ffmpeg or it will not work.
* Make a folder and git clone this repository: https://github.com/broomez420/The-Watcher-v2-new.git
* Then type "npm install" to get the needed packages for the bot
* in The Examples folder, the ConfigSammy, ConfigJack and ConfigBen, are not needed, i use the files and steam totp to get my 2FA Code for each account
